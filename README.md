<h1 align="center">Ladder</h1>

<h2>LADDER HAS BEEN ARCHIVED AND IS NOW LONGER AVAILABLE ON MY SERVER DUE TO:</h2>

- It doen't really work 80% of the time (this is the main reason)
- There are browser plugins that work better and do not require the use of any third-party server (like mine) as a gateway/proxy
- It was abused by bots and ai and it's structure doesn't support using anti-ai gateways like anubis on it
- It was abused by assholes who want to access pornographic content, pirated and other illegal stuff over ladder as a proxy

Don't get false hopes, it will never return. You'll have to bypass paywalls yourself
